Day3: 

When using FLEX you should align-items: center to avoid stretching

justify-content:
	flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
	flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
	center: Items align at the center of the container.
	space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
	space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.

align-items:
	flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
	flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
	center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
	baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
	stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.
align-self: use this like align-items on an individual element in a flex container
align-content: use this for vertical spacing between rows


flex-direction:
	row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
	row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
	column: Items are placed top to bottom.
	column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.

flex-wrap: use to keep things from squishing, kick them off to next line
flex-flow: combines flex-wrap and flex-direction

look into position but try not to abuse it

Day4:

Position

Relative: let's you use left, top right, bot to move the element relative to it's usual position

Absolute: positions it relative to it's "nearest positioned ancestor"
-often used with before and after pseudo class

Fixed: positioned relative to the viewport

Sticky: uses relative or fixed based on the users conditions
